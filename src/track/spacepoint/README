LibCsSpacePoint.so 
is designed to create spacepoints from a set of detectors consisting in a family. SpacePoints consist either in 
 - 2 coordinates (x,y) at a given z (Fast minimisation). 
 - 2 coordinates at z + 2 angles    (Full minimisation)
Fast minimisation requires at least 3 detectors.
Full minimisation requires at least 5 detectors.

Might be helpfull for internal calibration of small sets of detectors. 
Some switches have been added so that it works (with reasonable speed) on either alignment runs or physics run.
Second option is presently beeing tested.

Tests have been performed only for SDCs. 
Most probably it works only for these detectors at the moment. 
It may be generalised to other detectors (straw?) if needed.

WARNING: CsResOpt.cc uses Root implementation of Minuit. Minuit library is not included by default in the Root standard library packages defined by General.mk.
Therefore when linking LibCsSpacePoint library to a Main program, -lMinuit has to be added by hand to $(Libs). 

i.e: LIBS+=-lMinuit in GNUMakefile.

Examples for using LibCsSpacePoint objects can be found in src/tests/realdata.
Root macros to display output histograms  can be found in src/tests/realdata/root.
Directory src/tests/spacepoints was designed to test spacePoints on MC data but is obselete at the moment.
