COMPASS Event Display based one ROOT's TEve
===========================================

Enable it by configuring CORAL with the "--enable-NewEDIS" options.

Unfortunately the standard ROOT geometry cannot be used, as the axis from that
geometry created from COMGeant are not correct. The geometry required for the
event display needs to adhere to the standard CORAL conventions (X: from
Saleve to Jura, Y: from bottom to top, Z along the beam axis). The
"convert.pl" script does that. Also the geometry has to be saved in a ROOT
file, not as a macro.

Example how to create a suitable geometry:
./convert $COMPASS_FILES/geometry/2012/ROOTGeometry/detectors.primakoff.r371.C
root detectors.C
[0] gGeoManager->SetTitle("COMPASS geometry for the event display")
[1] gGeoManager->Export("detectors.root", "evdisgeo")

The event display can be controlled by two options:

* The tag "event display" switches the event display on.
* The geometry has to be defined by the "event display geometry" option.

Example (append to the CORAL options file):
event display
event display   geometry    [path to special geometry from above]
