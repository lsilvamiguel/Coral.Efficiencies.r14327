Use tst.options to run test MC job
Use rd.options to run the low intensity real data
Use hi.options to run the high intensity real data
(Do not forget to get a file with real data).
For most of the real data runs calibrations in *.clb
files are OK, except some of high intensity runs, where constants are
shifted by ~25 counts.

Because general calibration procedure in CORAL is not yet ready, 
procedure use uncalibrated CsDigits and make calibration itself. 
If procedure will ask Gerassimov's calibration files for ScFi (*.txt) 
 - you have  to supplay it with 0 values  (contact to S.Gerassimov).
You don't need to have a calibraion for MC job - default values will be used.  



To run test program:
1) make
3)Linux/test tst.options
