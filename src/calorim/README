This is calorimeter's part of COMPASS software.
Note, that subdirectory with name "Reco" contains code that is NOT
CORAL part. This is independent general-purpose library for
reconstruction of data from any cellular calorimeter.

With "make Linux/calorim" you can produce executable ./Linux/calorim.
The source calorim.cc is just a sort of coral user's program.
In the output ...root file one can find a lot of histograms which might
be useful for calorimeters tests and calibrations.
Examples of calorimeters reconstruction options can be found in the files
../src/pkopt/calorim.opt calorim_mc.opt.
