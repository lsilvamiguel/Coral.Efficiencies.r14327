 This is the user directory. And it provides what an user directory usually
provides, viz.:
  I) Options files.
 II) Templates for "UserEvent" and "UserBeginning/EndOfJob".
III) Makefile for building an executable.
     Note still that coral software is only put to best use when it's
    interfaced w/ PHAST, cf. the "coral" sub-dir of your PHAST distribution, and
    the README there.
     In particular, executables built from this directory will NOT be able to
    produce mDSTs.
     Yet, the present options files include all what's needed to run a PHAST
    job.

 I) Options files
-----------------
  - They should be able to run an example job as is.
  - Otherwise they have be edited: cf. comments in any file's header for
   instructions on how to proceed.
  - There are several kinds:

  i) Standard options files for Real Data (RD) =

             "trafdic.<year>[.extension].opt"

     - Are valid for magnets on data.
     - Otherwise, are supposed to cover all of data taking, with:
      - Automatic search for relevant geometry info based upon run number.
      - Unique set of options for the rest.
       Yet, to be edited for specifying input data file, selection criteria,
       output, or else... Cf. comments in file's header.
     - Muon files are  meant for both longitudinal and transverse. Have to edit
      the entry specifying the target field map for the latter.

    NOTA BENE:
     - The files themselves are NOT part of the coral distribution: they are
      instead compiled from an ".opt.c" template, to handle the settings that
      depend upon the particular computer system one is running on. The same
      compilation mechanism allows one to produce special options files, e.g.
      for histogramming residuals, etc.., by specifying "C2OPT_FLAG" as an
      argument to the "make trafdic.<year>.opt" command line.
     - Do not confuse these "trafdic.*.opt" files of the "user" directory,
      w/  "trafdic.*.opt" in the "../pkopt" directory.

 ii) MC files:

             "trafdic.mc.<year>.opt"

     - Several COMGeant versions are provided for, with alternative entries
      specified in commented lines. Cf. comments in file's header.

iii) More specific files: cf. comments in files' header.

II) Code
-------
  i) main
 ii) User files
    - The user should modify only these.
    - They are:

      CoralUser.cc
      CoralUser.h

    - There are three empty functions inside:

      CoralUserInit
      CoralUserEvent
      CoralUserEnd

    - CoralUserInit: It can be used for initialization stuff (
                    histograms booking etc...).

    - CoralUserEvent: Event analysis processes should be put here.

    - CoralUserEnd: For final procedures.
