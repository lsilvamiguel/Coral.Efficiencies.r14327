\mainpage DaqDataDecoding - library for decoding COMPASS events
\section intro Introduction
  The purpose of this library is to provide a tool
  that can be used to decode COMPASS events written in
  DATE format.

  This library can be used both in CORAL (events reconstruction) and in ONLINE.
  It is very important to have a standard decoding library both for online
  and offline groups.

  Please read "Compass-Note 2000-8" about the structure of
  COMPASS data
