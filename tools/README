findobjects (10-APR-2001 Massimo):
This script walks through under all
CORAL subdirs and looks for object files
and other by-products of compilations
(namely oddlx files, depend.mk, Dict files) 
proposing the command lines to delete them
(by piping the output into sh).
Pipe the script into 
grep -v grep | grep hand | awk '{print $5" "$6}'
to remove the extra files, after having verified
you really want to delete them
